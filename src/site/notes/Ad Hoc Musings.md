With such noise and bustle around us, one cannot help but build a hermitage[^1] in one's mind for contemplation and peace.

This [digital garden](https://cagrimmett.com/notes/2020/11/08/what-are-digital-gardens/) contains some contemplations and musings from my retreats there.

Unsurprisingly, thoughts here are, like every thought, ever-changing.

If you have any questions or opinions, please feel free to contact me at [fhoque1515@gmail.com](mailto:fhoque1515@gmail.com) or see the [[The Threshold#Discussion\|Discussion]] section for other options.

## Maturity Levels
The maturity level for each note is represented by phases of a star and their icons of various growth.

### Stellar Nebulas
Stellar Nebulas (![Maturity Level: 1|14](https://adhocmusings.vercel.app/img/1.svg)) are thoughts barely started. They are primarily ideas, impromptu musings that I wrote down, and are meant to be expanded later.

### Stars
Stars (![Maturity Level: 2|14](https://adhocmusings.vercel.app/img/2.svg))have a good amount of content. However, they still need to be fleshed out. Ideas are being solidified in this stage.

### Red Giants
Red Giant (![Maturity Level: 3|14](https://adhocmusings.vercel.app/img/3.svg)) are grown-up coherent pieces of thought/essay/expression that should not change much except for some editorial enhancements.

### Supernovas
Supernovas (![Maturity Level: withered|14](https://adhocmusings.vercel.app/img/4.svg)) are the notes that are more filled with corrections, or comments collected from other sources or opinions regarding an idea I have discussed.

### Black Holes
Black Holes (![Maturity Level: withered|14](https://adhocmusings.vercel.app/img/5.svg)) are the notes expressing outdated views (totally or partially) but kept for the historicity of our thoughts. For partially outdated notes, warnings will be placed wherever appropriate.
### Galaxies
Galaxies (![Maturity Level: stone|14](https://adhocmusings.vercel.app/img/6.svg)) are notes scraped or pulled from other mediums (e.g. Reading highlights and notes). Growth is irrelevant for these notes.

### Telescope
Telescopes (![Maturity Level: signpost|14](https://adhocmusings.vercel.app/img/7.svg)) are notes that allow us to navigate easily (e.g. Collection of books or writings).

### Satellites
A Satellite (![Maturity Level: chest|14](https://adhocmusings.vercel.app/img/8.svg)) get changes in its content. However, they don't grow. Chests are how-to's and tools I have made.

## ðŸ’¬ Discussion
Digital gardens are not about marketing or grandstanding. They are about nurturing thoughts publicly and collectively.

### ðŸ“© Emails Â 
From any note's page, click the email button on the bottom right to start an email thread. This is private.

### ðŸ’¬ Comments Â 
Every note has a comment section powered by Disqus. Feel free to use that if you don't mind public discussions.

### ðŸ§­ Policy Â 
If you find anything praiseworthy (I doubt you will), tell me privately. For commenting, here are the only rules:

1. Constructive criticism only.

2. Follow logic â€” no personal attacks, no fallacies.

3. Be civil. Always.
