By the definition above, I am, what is considered, a radical. I admit, this was not always the case, I do not believe a person is born a radical. I do, however believe, that it is a natural occurrence of intelligent species to deduce right from wrong, especially when it comes to morals and ethics. Sure, sometimes it can be grey, but not on issues such as human rights and lives. Those are plain black and white. 

However, the only people who have yet to be radicalized are once who are so ignorant and out of touch, that they live in their own little bubble, or people who are raised in well-equipped, resourceful and healthy environments. But I beg to differ that the latter group of people can ever exist, especially in this age, where the internet has given us a route to gain access to news and injustices taking place all of the world.

So, how did I become radicalized. I grew up in an extremely toxic extended family, where I was being manipulated since I was just five-years-old, and that too, using my favorite candy. My relative would lure secrets out of me regarding my parents in exchange for candy. When my mother finally understood what was going on, in order to protect our family, I had to lose my innocence. The innocence of seeing the good in everyone, and to see the truth that people who  provide you the promise of happiness, often do not have the best of interest for you or others you care for. However, this was also the beginning for me to gain class consciousness, and I'll explain that once the tipping point arises.

Fast forward to when I got into 7th grade, and started reading YA Romance Novels, and watching K-Dramas, I could hardly ever relate to the plotline. It was always the rich guy and the poor girl, the savior complex, etc. I am truly thankful that I had the privilege in the first place to not relate to the female protagonists (e.g. Boys Over Flowers, the Selection Series, etc.), yet, it just felt wrong to me. I wanted and read about rich female protagonists, or those who basically did not need saving and was on equal footing with the male protagonist. I believe, that was also my reason for coming to despise the romance genre, because that was all it consisted of most of the time.

However, it came as a surprise to me how popular these shows were. Just look at Boys Over Flowers, it was manga, got adapted to an anime, and has been adapted to limited series all across Asian countries. Yet, I was so disturbed by the whole plot, and it traumatized me about rich men. The male protagonist has time and time again sexually harassed, mentally and emotionally abused the female protagonist, and you kind of see that their whole elite school feeds into the classism agenda. I am not sure why it was being marketed as a Romance manga, when it reality it could have been a cautionary tale of the consequence of wealth inequality, resulting in wealthy people getting away with almost everything.

I genuinely have grown to be distasteful of the whole franchise. However, I will say it has helped me understand the world a lot more to the point I started noticing it all around me. Which brings me back to my candy incident. This whole power dynamic of the rich versus the poor is something I realize was what happened to me. My relative had something I loved and wanted, so they used that to their advantage to trade in for something that is more detrimental to them just losing some assets, which is gaining access to resources to directly harm me and closed ones to me, who they considered the threat. I thought I was being accepted, becoming close to family, and this is exactly how rich people continue to thrive despite being outnumbered.

They thrive using people, selling false dreams to individuals who have less, luring them into thinking they too can become ;ole them if they stick close by. All of this is possible now more than ever thanks to capitalism, which thrives on such individualistic mindset. If you gain empathy, awareness, and education, they can no longer sell such ideologies to you. When you work within a community for a community, you see the world bigger than your selfish desires. You realize that your aspirations of getting to the top is hardly possible if you do it on your own. Human beings have emerged and grown from the wilderness and became civilized because we had loyalty, community to look out for one another. However, in this day and age, with so much division, that is why we are so static. That is why the rich are able to thrive, unopposed, that is why revolution takes so long to happen. Selfishness, lack of compassion, mindless consumption, classism is what causing all of these.
